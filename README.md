Vim Dotfiles
============
Using Vim's scripting language (and a great deal of insight and tools from others),
I have setup Vim on my local machine to be an effective development environment
for my needs.  Using GitHub, I can replicate this Vim environment across the
multiple systems I'm presently use.

I will explain here how I established the git environment on my local machine,
how I established a GitHub for that environment, how to replicate the Vim envirnment
to another machine, and how to update both the local git repository and GitHub.
